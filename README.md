# EEG2Text  

⚡ Transform brain signals into meaningful text  

EEG2Text is an experimental project exploring the intersection of **neuroscience, machine learning, and natural language processing**.  
The goal is to decode raw EEG signals and map them into human-readable text.

## ✨ Features  
- 🧠 Preprocessing pipeline for EEG signal data  
- 🤖 Signal-to-text model architecture  
- 🔬 Modular design for experimentation  
- 🌍 Open-source for contributions and improvements
